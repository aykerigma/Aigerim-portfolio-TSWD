## Final Project

A high-level summary of your project.  This should be a sentence or two that describes what you're interested in showing with your final project.
A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe what you hope to achieve.  

### Project outline
Summary 
Structure 

In this project I want to convince policy makers and general population to work/donate/raise awareness about fast development of artificial intelligence that is not followed by equally fast development of relevant laws and policies. 

This is my outline: 

Problem statement: 
Gap between AI progress and AI laws, policies 
- Rise of AI 
  - AI investments 
  - Number of publications 
  - Number of patents
- Evidence of lack of AI laws
  - Mentions of AI 
  - AI bills by country


Risks of this gap 
- misaligned AI 
- orthogonality thesis 
- bad examples of misuse of AI

Orthogonality thesis 
Prediction of development - ??? No idea about dataset. Maybe just omit this part. 
Risks 
Companies compete without oversight - have a dataset, patents, publications
Examples of how it’s already going wrong 
Countries (dictatorships) do this to stay in power
Example of Xinjiang 
Lack of policies - have a dataset already, AI bills 
Solutions: 
Who’s working on this - cset 
Donate 
Advocate 
Something else

### Data

For the project I will use two data sources: publicly available data for AI Index Report by Stanford University's Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence Institue and Center for Security and Emerging Technology's database on progress in AI by top companies in the world. For now, I have identified three datasets that I will use. I may need to find more as I develop my project.

### Method and Medium

I am planning to use shorthand and create a longread with visualization and text.
