## Final Project

A high-level summary of your project.  This should be a sentence or two that describes what you're interested in showing with your final project.
A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe what you hope to achieve.

### Data

For the project I will use two data sources: publicly available data for AI Index Report by Stanford University's Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence Institue and Center for Security and Emerging Technology's database on progress in AI by top companies in the world. For now, I have identified three datasets that I will use. I may need to find more as I develop my project.
