## Final Project

In this project I want to inform policy makers about fast development of artificial intelligence that is not followed by equally fast development of relevant laws and policies. Intended outcome of reading this project is action to explore more on this topic, advocate, donate, and work directly on creating policies for safe development of AI.

### Project outline

Problem statement: 
Gap between AI progress and AI laws, policies 
- Rise of AI 
  - AI investments 
  - Number of publications 
  - Number of patents
- Evidence of lack of AI laws
  - Mentions of AI 
  - AI bills by country

Risks of this gap: 
- misaligned AI 
- orthogonality thesis 
- bad examples of misuse of AI

Solutions:
- Who is working on this already
- What you can do
  - Advocate
  - Work on AI safety 
  - Work in AI policy

### Data

For the project I will use two data sources: publicly available data for AI Index Report by Stanford University's Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence Institue and Center for Security and Emerging Technology's database on progress in AI by top companies in the world. For now, I have identified three datasets that I will use. I may need to find more as I develop my project.

### Method and Medium

I am planning to use Floursih and Tableau for creating charts and Shorthand for making the final project.
