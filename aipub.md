core audience of the report are policymakers. so it's crucial to make it so clear that policymakers don't need a degree in CS to understand them. 

This is a good graph. It doesn’t score too low on any of the metrics. The reader can immediately see the dramatic growth of pattern recognition and machine learning publications in the recent years. The colors are not too bright. There’s hierarchy of font sizes. The title describes the graph well. 

However, I think that this graph can be changed to serve its target audience better. The main problem of this visualization and other graphs in this report is the mismatch between the audience background knowledge on the topic and the chart. The chart looks like it was made for researchers who can draw meaningful conclusions about the difference in publications between computer vision and control theory, for example. 

I think the title should be different. Because in the written part, authors mention how it is the deep learning method of AI that’s changing and affecting the field, and that’s why topics related to deep learning are experiencing such growth: machine learning, computer vision, and pattern recognition in particular. 

I would change the colors of the lines to highlight only the ones relevant for interpretation. Probably even making all other lines grey and 3-4 lines distinct colors. I would add a couple of vertical lines to mark the dates when certain AI milestones were achieved. 

Authors in the introduction state that the mission of the report is "to provide data for policymakers, executives, journalists, and the general public to develop a more thorough understanding of the field of AI". And it’s most likely that policymakers, journalists and the general public don’t know much about publications in the different sectors of AI field. The intention that emerges from reading the report is that AI is developing more rapidly than the laws and policies that should protect people. And the visualization should show this and give urgency to the problem of safe AI development. 
Instead, this visualization shows us the rise in AI publications since about 2016 and not much else. So I would say it's not effective at reaching its audience. Because the audience needs a more clear explanation of what to focus on, which lines among all of them are more important, what does it mean that there's a rise in publications, why should they care. There is accurate information presented but I think it needs more focus.
