# About me

I'm Aigerim, a second year MSPPM student. My pronouns are she/her. I'm from Almaty, Kazakhstan. In my free time I like hiking. 
In Fall 2022, I took a course 'Telling Stories with Data' and this is a portfolio of my work. 

# What I learned from this course 

#### * to think about my audience first
#### * to develop my message and story to that audience
#### * to simplify visualizations and make them consistent between each other
#### * to know what I want to say with a graph and how it will support my story before I start making it 
#### * to sketch before I try to make a graph with any software
#### * to have a clear call to action at the end of my story

# Portfolio
