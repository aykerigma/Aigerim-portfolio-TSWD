## Final project, part III

[Here's a link to shorthand with the final data story.](/https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/ai-is-developing-rapidly-but-few-laws-ensure-its-safety/index.html) 

[Part I](/final_project_aigerim_massabayeva.md)

[Part II](/part2.md)

### Target audience 
 
I didn't want to make my story limited only to one audience, either students or policy makers. I wanted to make it accessible and useful for a general audience because I think the issue of AI alignment are relevant and important for everyone. Which is why I assumed that my audience is not knowledgeable about AI but has interest in it. I tried to make my story as engaging as possible, simplifying technical terms, and making data visualization as easy-to-read as possible. 

For example, in my dataset, there were a lot of data about accuracy and performance of different AI models. I took only the most shocking data, like almost 100% accuracy rate for facial recognition. And I made titles easy and non-technical. 

I also included a few examples from the news to make the story feel relevant to the reader. Like the fact that AI is used in everyday life, it determines a bank loan or screens job applicants. 

Finally, I separated my call to action into three categories: policy maker, citizen, student. Citizen is the broadest category, if people are not willing to change their career based on this story, at least they can inform themselves. But if they are really interested, they can advocate for policy changes and become an independent researcher. 
 
### Changes from Part II

Main changes since Part II were references, the block on performance of AI, and a more detailed description in different parts. 

When I was going through my story, I found that it lacked a piece about how good AI is getting. It was not enough to show examples of misuses, I wanted some data about scary new capabilities AI has now. Which is why I included two graphs, one about sentiment analysis, one about facial recognition. I think that block is very necessary to bring home the point that AI policy is urgently needed. 

In the part on risks from unregulated AI development, I added "Learn more" buttons which take you to relevant websites. The topic of AI is very rich and my story is only an introduction to all the information that exists on that topic. And I wanted to make it easier for the reader to access quality information through my story.
