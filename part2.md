# Final project part II

## Storyboard

[Here's a link to my storyboard in Shorthand](/storyboard.md)

## User research 

### Target audience 

* public policy students
* computer science students
* someone unfamiliar with neither computer science or public policy

### Interview scrpit
 
Introduction  
  Present yourself and the project. 
  Ask for permission to take notes and quote them anonymously. 

Questions 
  Can you tell me what main conclusion you make form looking at this? 
  What stood out to you? 
  What was surprising? 
  What you didn't understand or found confusing? 
  What would you change? 

Wrap-up 

Thank you! Do you have any questions for me? 

### Results

Person 1 
(Computer science PhD student)

'Nice. Wow. Good. I like the story, full screen texts' 
'transitions are of the same category. when you transition between sections, use another type of transition between slides'
'are animal picuters intentional or placeholders? I thought it was sarcastic, like governments are doing nothing and foxes are'
'shift the graph up for focus areas, add heading'
'graphs are a little naked, I don't know what to take away from this. Add a heading with a key takeaway'

Person 2 
(Person unfamiliar with neither computer science or public policy. She works in digital marketing)

'Very interesting. Cool topic. Pictures are funny. I liked the charts.'
'Maybe you can add that cases of misuse of AI are widely discussed?'

Person 3
(Public policy student)

'This is cool. A bit overwhelming.'
She said that there are many colors and photos. 

### Changes

1. Add title to each graph, write a couple of sentences explaning the main point. 
2. Make clearer the connections between charts and the story. 
3. Think about a unifying color pallete and choose background images accordingly.  
4. Add different types of transitions between slides in shorthand to signal if the transition is within the same topic or passing to a new section.
5. Try to find data on papers published by universities to contrast with papers by companies.
